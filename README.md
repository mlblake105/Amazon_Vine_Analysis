# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Project Overview
The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.  In this review we will look at shoes dataset to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members.
